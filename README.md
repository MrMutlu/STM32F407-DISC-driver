My training attempt to learn STM32F407VG Discovery board drivers , ( SPI, I2C , USART etc... ) and not use STM32CubeMX. 
I used STM32CubeIDE on Eclipse and tried to comment and explain each thing as i understand it for a reference.
I am watching and learning from FastBit Academy's videos, currently doing "Mastering Microcontroller and Embedded Driver Development" lectures and hopefully continue to do other ones.
